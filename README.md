# BarcodeToPBM

Tiny Program to save a .pbm (Portable Bitmap Format) file from a binary-style-string, typed into the console (e.g. 11001010)

Height is hardcoded set to 30 pixel, width is the size(length) of the string.

No error-exceptions added, therefore works only with 1s and 0s.

Use and modify as you like.
